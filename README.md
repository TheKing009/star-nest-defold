# Star Nest Tutorial

This project is a recreation of the [Star Nest](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XlfGRj)  by Pablo Andrioli (user “Kali” on Shadertoy) from Shadertoy in [Defold](https://defold.com). It is a purely procedural and mathematical fragment shader that renders a really cool starfield effect.

Happy Defolding!
